    contains the logic to create and initualize Array objects and define exceptions
description:
    Arrays can be created, added, subtracted, output and other operations 
    such as <,>,<=, >=, ==, =.

Testing: Incomplete. There seems to be a problem with my resize function and it is causing the out of range exception to throw whenever the resize is used thus causing a core dump :(
