    contains the logic to create and initualize date objects and define exceptions
description:
    dates can be created, added, subtracted, output and other operations 
    such as <,>,<=, >=, ==, =.

Testing: There are lots of known bugs at this time. The Exception class throws exceptions but they are not caught by the catch block. The mathematic operaters are not complete, increment and decriment are not complete.
